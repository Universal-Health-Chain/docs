## **Summary**

UHC is a **decentralized communication platform for secure data exchange**.

UHC v2 utilizes both *Hyperledger Fabric* blockchain technology, *OpenID* standards, the *Financial-grade (FAPI) Security Profile* and *Post Quantum Computing (PQC)* algorithms for secure data communications.

UHC is a resilient system designed to securely communicate patients and authorized persons (legal guardians, caregivers, etc.) with health services and vice versa. It allows health services, healthcare professionals, payers, patients and authorized persons to share verifiable documents and verifiable digital identities, using  Universal Health Identifiers (patented technology) and HL7 FHIR as an international standard for data exchange ([USA](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi), [EU](https://international-patient-summary.net/cen-and-iso-have-aligned-their-work/), [G7](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045267/G7-open-standards-final-report.pdf), [India](https://www.nrces.in/standards/hl7-international/hl7-fhir), [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/digital/estandares), etc.), converting data from other formats to FHIR and vice versa. It also facilitates research studies to obtain anonymized medical records for research and statistics (digital twins).

### **Blockchain**

Blockchain technology is a tool used in UHC to provide a chain of trust, traceability and to prevent unauthorized access or modifications of both digital identities, permissions and documents generated.

The UNID blockchain network is based on the Hyperledger Fabric: an open, proven, enterprise-grade, distributed ledger platform developed by The Linux Foundation.

It has advanced privacy controls and it has been designed for healthcare and research (healthcare providers, laboratories, health authorities, healthcare professionals, researchers) without cryptocurrencies, where all member identities are known and authenticated and where patients and professionals can validate the authenticity of both the digital identities of the different stakeholders in the health chain and the documents generated in medical care, using Universal Health Identifiers (patented technology).

### **OpenID**

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party identity provider (IdP) service.

<p>&nbsp  </p>

### **Financial-grade API (FAPI)**

Financial-grade API (FAPI) is an industry-led specification developed by the OpenID Foundation. The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile is an API security profile based on the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework (RFC6749) and related specifications suitable for protecting APIs in high-value scenarios.

While the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile was initially developed with a focus on financial applications, it is designed to be universally applicable for protecting APIs exposing high-value and sensitive (personal and other) data, for example, in e-health and e-government applications.

<p>&nbsp  </p>

### **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**

Within a few short years quantum computers will crack the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) and ECC (elliptic-curve cryptography) cryptographic algorithms on which today's digital systems depend.

The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.
