## **2. Universal, decentralized identity**

Providing a universal, digital and verifiable identity for each individual in the healthcare ecosystem is a key element, not only for professionals but for donors, patients and related persons such as family members, legal guardians and caregivers.

A same person can have several jurisdictional identifiers in one or more territories (e.g.: citizenship card, public health card, national identity document, driver's license and/or passport) and local identifiers as worker or customer from different organizations such as healthcare providers, diagnostic laboratories, public or private insurance companies, etc. All those identifiers shall remain private (they are personal data) and only be disclosed to trusted third parties.

Additionally, a public, decentralized and collision-free Unique Universal Identifier (UUID v4) for multiple purposes can be generated for the same person by using a software application, such as a multipurpose identifier for cross border healthcare, as defined in the Unified Identification Protocol for Training and Health (US-20200211409-A1).

After that, the person (holder of the information) can generate unique self-generated cryptographic material to create a Decentralized Identity Document (DID Document) containing both a multipurpose identifier as the DID of the public identity (which is the identifier of the DID Document), public JSON Web Key(s) (JWK) as the cryptographic material for the public identity, and optionally one or more jurisdictional, professional or customer identifiers.

The status of the public keys can be blockchain certified and so are the identifiers of both people, organizations, departments, qualifications, consents, medical records and medical products. The DID Document of an organization can be published in its URL in the “did.json” file as defined in the Well Known DID Configuration specification. This cryptographic material can be generated by using some of the winning algorithms from the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization program and competition launched in 2016 by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology in USA). 

To comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), a Hyperledger Fabric network can be used by one or more federations of organizations. In this way, the root organizations in the network can include a new organization in one or more channels of the Fabric network, and the new organization can start registering the digital identities of: departments, offices, locations, workers and users (customers such as patients or donors, and related persons).

In this way, a federated organization has the traceability of the cryptographic material associated with the entities registered on the blockchain in the Hyperledger Fabric network .

An organization can issue a batch of electronic and physical credentials for its employees and customers by using one or more ephemeral PQC cryptographic keys, but also other electronic credentials containing health and personal data when requested by individuals, where each key is traceable on blockchain and can be verified by any other entity in the federated network.

Both electronic and physical credentials issued by an organization can contain some data of the issuer such as the public cryptographic key used to sign the credential, where the ID of the public signature key (keyID or “kid”) is the thumbprint of the public key as per the IETF RFC 7638 specification (SHA-256 of the public JSON Web Key).

A cache memory with all the non-revoked keyIDs used by the federated organizations to generate electronic credentials can be stored in the software applications, used by end-users such as individuals (professionals, customers, related persons) but also by IOT devices. In this way, each time an electronic or physical credential is read, both the public key and its status and validity period can be known by the reader.
